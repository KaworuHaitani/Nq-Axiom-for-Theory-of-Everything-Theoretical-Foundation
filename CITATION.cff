abstract: "A comprehensive theoretical foundation extending the Nq axiom Var(Ô) = ℏω(1+C)/N from static quantum 
systems to dynamic cosmological theory. This framework addresses major unsolved problems in modern cosmology including dark matter properties, dark energy dynamics, primordial inflation mechanisms, and the Hubble tension through unified variance-correlation principles. The theory provides novel solutions to cosmological puzzles by connecting 
quantum fluctuations to cosmic-scale phenomena through scale and time-dependent correlation parameters, offering 
testable predictions for current and future cosmological observations including CMB measurements, large-scale structure 
surveys, and gravitational wave detection."
